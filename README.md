Project Proposal #1

Tracking Inventory and Online Ordering System for Small Businesses

Problem: Small businesses often face challenges managing their online and in-store inventory. Many of them don’t have a proper system for order tracking, customer management, and secure data (client information). Without automation, mistakes can lead to lost sales, overstocking, poor customer satisfaction, and data leaks.

Solution: We propose the development of a web-based platform that integrates a Customer Portal, Real time viewing of Inventory, Secure Deployment, and an Admin Dashboard.

Our main objectives for this project are:
•	Build a functional, user-friendly platform that can be accessed through your phone or desktop
•	Real-time inventory synchronization (between the database and the webpage’s UI)
•	Provide an admin dashboard for managing products and tracking product performance.
•	Secure deployment with encrypted data and up-to-standard user authentication.
